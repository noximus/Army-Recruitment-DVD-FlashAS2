					<questions>
						<question>
							<q>Is enrolling in Army ROTC the same as joining the Army? Once a student starts taking ROTC courses, is he/she obligated to join the Army?</q>
							<a>Young adults must serve as Officers in the Army after graduation if they have received an ROTC scholarship, or if they have enrolled in the ROTC Advanced Course. Enrolling in the ROTC Basic Course (the first two years of college) does NOT obligate someone to serve unless they have also received a scholarship. For more details, see: Your Commitment.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>What kinds of scholarships are available in Army ROTC? </q>
							<a>Army ROTC scholarships vary based on the length of time remaining for students to complete their degrees. There are two-, three- and four-year scholarships, which pay for tuition and fees up to $20,000 per year. Scholarships also include annual book allowances and a monthly stipend. Army ROTC scholarships are not retroactive.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>What is my young adult's Army service obligation to pay back any scholarship benefits, or for enrollment in the ROTC Advanced Course?</q>
							<a>Scholarship winners must serve for four years; non-scholarship Cadets who enroll in the ROTC Advanced Course must serve for three years. All who graduate and complete ROTC training are commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the U.S. Army.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>What good is Army ROTC for a career outside of the Army?</q>
							<a>Army ROTC is one of the only college courses that teaches leadership. This training is invaluable for any career that involves leading, managing and motivating people or fostering teamwork. Young Army Officers are typically responsible for hundreds of Soldiers and millions of dollars in equipment; this kind of management experience can be very attractive for post-Army employers.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>Why should my young adult choose Army ROTC over a different branch's ROTC?</q>
							<a>The Army offers a wider range of career opportunities, in more places around the world, then any other U.S. military branch.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>Are all college majors compatible with Army ROTC?</q>
							<a>Army ROTC Cadets are allowed to major in nearly all academic areas.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>What are Army ROTC courses like? How will the class work help my young adult? Will ROTC classes interfere with his/her other studies?</q>
							<a>Army ROTC classes normally involve one elective class or lab per semester. Although the classes involve hands-on fieldwork as well as classroom work, they are standard college classes that fit into a normal academic schedule. These courses can help students with personal and academic decision-making while giving them the tools to exercise leadership in college life, even before graduating and becoming Officers.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>How will being an Army ROTC Cadet affect my young adult's daily life? Do Cadets experience normal college life and activities?</q>
							<a>Army ROTC Cadets have the same lifestyles and academic schedules as any other college students. But there are two intensive Army ROTC courses that take place on Army Posts, usually during the summer:
Leader's Training Course—This four-week summer course at Fort Knox, KY is ONLY for students who enroll in Army ROTC going into their junior years without having taken the first two years of military science classes.
Leader Development and Assessment Course—All Cadets who enter the Advanced Course must attend this four-week summer course at Fort Lewis, WA between their junior and senior years.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>Can my young adult go into the Army Reserve or National Guard after graduation instead of the regular Army?</q>
							<a>Yes. Selected Cadets may choose to serve part-time in the U.S. Army Reserve or Army National Guard while pursuing a civilian career.</a>
						</question>
						<question>
							<q>What is the typical career path for an Army Officer? What career fields are available?</q>
							<a>Army ROTC graduates are commissioned as U.S. Army Second Lieutenants. They then receive specialized training in one of 17 different Army branches. During their Army careers, they'll receive regular professional training as they advance through the ranks, and they'll have many opportunities for advanced leadership positions and post-graduate education.</a>
